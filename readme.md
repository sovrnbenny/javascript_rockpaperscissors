Project: Rock Paper Scissors

As part of The Odin Project, foundations course, the task at hand is to create a program from scratch in javascript.

This program is simply to take human input and random computer input together to play a game of rock, paper, scissors.

This is my first attempt at write anything in Javascript. 

Wish me luck.
